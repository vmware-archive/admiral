All rights reserved.


LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS

1. License for Evaluation Purposes. Specification Lead hereby grants
you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited
license (without the right to sublicense), under Specification Lead's
applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, use and
reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal
evaluation.  This includes (i) developing applications intended to run
on an implementation of the Specification, provided that such
applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of the
Specification, and (ii) discussing the Specification with any third
party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions of the Specification in oral
or written communications which discuss the Specification provided that
such excerpts do not in the aggregate constitute a significant portion
of the Specification.


2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations.
Specification Lead  also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, limited
license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable
copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection 4 below, patent
rights it may have covering the Specification to create and/or
distribute an Independent Implementation of the Specification that: (a)
fully implements the Specification including all its required
interfaces and functionality; (b) does not modify, subset, superset or
otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include any public or
protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within
the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the
Specification or Specifications being implemented; and (c) passes the
Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the requirements of
the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification ("Compliant
Implementation").  In addition, the foregoing license is expressly
conditioned on your not acting outside its scope.  No license is
granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for example,
modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of your fair use
rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).  Also, no
right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service marks, or
trade names of Specification Lead or Specification Lead's licensors is
granted hereunder.  Java, and Java-related logos, marks and names are
trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle America, Inc. in the U.S.
and other countries.


3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c)
from the previous paragraph or any other particular "pass through"
requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of your
Independent Implementation or products derived from it.  However,
except with respect to Independent Implementations (and products
derived from them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous
paragraph, You may neither:  (a) grant or otherwise pass through to
your licensees any licenses under Specification Lead's  applicable
intellectual property rights; nor (b) authorize your licensees to make
any claims concerning their implementation's compliance with the
Specification in question.


4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.  

a.  With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted
under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically
feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is
conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a
perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under
Your patent rights which are or would be infringed by all technically
feasible implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute
and use a Compliant Implementation.

b.  With respect to any patent claims owned by Specification Lead and
covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not
their infringement can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when
implementing the Specification, such license shall terminate with
respect to such claims if You initiate a claim against Specification
Lead that it has, in the course of performing its responsibilities as
the Specification Lead, induced any other entity to infringe Your
patent rights.

c.  Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Specification Lead
and covered by the license granted under subparagraph 2 above, where
the infringement of such claims can be avoided in a technically
feasible manner when implementing the Specification such license, with
respect to such claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against
Specification Lead  that its making, having made, using, offering to
sell, selling or importing a Compliant Implementation infringes Your
patent rights.


5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement:  "Independent
Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
neither derives from any of Specification Lead's  source code or binary
code materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license
from Specification Lead, includes any of Specification Lead's  source
code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space" shall mean the
public class or interface declarations whose names begin with "java",
"javax", "com.sun" and "com.oracle" or their equivalents in any
subsequent naming convention adopted by Oracle America, Inc. through
the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or
replacements thereof; and "Technology Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall
mean the test suite and accompanying TCK User's Guide provided by
Specification Lead  which corresponds to the Specification and that was
available either (i) from Specification Lead's 120 days before the
first release of Your Independent Implementation that allows its use
for commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120 days from such
release but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the
Specification.


This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
Specification Lead if you breach the Agreement or act outside the scope
of the licenses granted above.

REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT

CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY
WAY TO YOUR HAVING, IMPELEMENTING OR OTHERWISE USING USING  THE
SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF SPECIFICATION LEAD AND/OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  You will indemnify,
hold harmless, and defend Specification Lead and its licensors from any
claims arising or resulting from: (i) your use of the Specification;
(ii) the use or distribution of your Java application, applet and/or
implementation; and/or (iii) any claims that later versions or releases
of any Specification furnished to you are incompatible with the

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

9. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software. 

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code

as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise
make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.

    to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
     Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
     Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.

Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
   with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
   previous violation.

   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
   Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by
   any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
   digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
   a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
   and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
   public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
   the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
   to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
   sounds or images.

   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
   without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
   fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage
   of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
   electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
   more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
   Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
   steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
   were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
   marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
   a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
   incorporated in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
      the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
      You of the rights granted under this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
      of the rights granted under this License; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
      to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
      the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
      voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
      by You of the rights granted under this License.  The above rights
      may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
      hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
      modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
      in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights
      not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
   terms of this License.  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
   ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
   that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
   and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
   Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform
   the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on
   the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from
   You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms
   of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
   in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from
   the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
   You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
   to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
   required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
   upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
   remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b),
   as requested.

   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
   or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
   to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
   name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
   and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
   or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
   for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
   notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
   such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
   to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
   specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
   and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
   a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
   "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
   based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
   by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
   provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
   a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
   authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of
   these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
   for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
   may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
   attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights
   under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or
   imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
   Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
   or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
   permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
   or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
   Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
   or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
   be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
   agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
   of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
   make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
   modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
   Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
   as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
   applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
   right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
   but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR
BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
   Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
   licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
   full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
   will survive any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
   here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
   the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
   the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not
   serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been,
   or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
   this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
   as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
   under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
   terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
   of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
   action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
   reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
   and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
   and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
   with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
   agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
   here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
   may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
   modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
   for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
   September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
   Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
   the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
   rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction
   in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
   the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
   provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
   rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
   rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
   deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended
   to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.



--------------- SECTION 7: SIL Open Font License, V1.1 -----------

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.
TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
